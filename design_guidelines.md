# Design Guidelines: AI Automation Landing Page

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Inspired by Odivend.com's modern dark theme with AI automation focus. Clean, conversion-optimized design emphasizing trust and technical expertise.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Near-pitch-black #050507 (primary dark surface)
- **Text Primary**: Pure white #FFFFFF for headings and key content
- **Text Secondary**: Muted grey #9AA0A6 for body text and descriptions
- **Accent/CTA**: Vivid cyan #00E5FF for primary buttons and highlights
- **Card Backgrounds**: Subtle dark grey (#0A0A0B) with cyan border accents on hover

### Typography
- **Headings**: Poppins (600-800 weight) for bold, geometric impact
- **Body Text**: Inter (400-500 weight) for clean readability
- **Hierarchy**: Large hero headlines, medium section headers, readable body text

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing Primitives**: Use units of 4, 8, 16, and 24 for consistent spacing (p-4, m-8, gap-16, py-24)
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Maximum content width with centered alignment

### Component Library

**Video Section**:
- Responsive 16:9 YouTube embed
- Lazy loading with analytics tracking
- Secondary CTA placement near video

**Service Cards**:
- Three-column grid (responsive stack)

- Lift animation on hover
- Clean icons and bullet points

**Process Steps**:
- Linear three-step flow
- Numbered progression indicators

### Key Design Principles
1. **Conversion Focus**: Primary cyan CTAs dominate visual hierarchy
2. **Trust Building**: Professional dark theme with clean typography
3. **Performance**: Minimal animations, optimized loading
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
5. **Mobile Excellence**: Touch-friendly buttons, readable text sizes

### Visual Treatments
- **Buttons**: Rounded corners, cyan fills for primary actions
- **Cards**: Subtle shadows, hover lift effects
- **Gradients**: Minimal use, only for subtle background treatments
- **Contrast**: Sharp white-on-dark for maximum readability

### Images
No large hero background image required. Focus on:
- Clean geometric shapes and subtle patterns
- Service card icons (simple line art style)
- Social proof logos (minimal, monochrome)
- Video thumbnail placeholder until embed loads

This design emphasizes conversion through clear hierarchy, strategic use of cyan accents, and professional dark aesthetics that build trust in AI automation services.
