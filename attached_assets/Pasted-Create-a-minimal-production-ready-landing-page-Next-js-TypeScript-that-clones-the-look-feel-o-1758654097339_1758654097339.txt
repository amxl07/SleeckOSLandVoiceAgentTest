Create a minimal, production-ready landing page (Next.js + TypeScript) that clones the look & feel of https://www.odivend.com while simplifying components for faster load & conversion. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and make it easy to deploy to Vercel. Follow these exact requirements:

Project tech stack and setup
- Next.js 14 (or latest stable) with TypeScript.
- Tailwind CSS configured.
- Use Google Fonts: Poppins (for headings) and Inter (for body).
- Provide a `package.json` and a simple `README.md` with run instructions (`npm install`, `npm run dev`).
- Ensure the site is SEO & ad-conversion friendly (meta tags + open graph).

Design, theme & assets
- Global dark theme: near-pitch-black background `#050507` (or `#08080A`), white main text `#FFFFFF`.
- Accent / highlight color: vivid cyan `#00E5FF`.
- Secondary text: muted greys (e.g., `#9AA0A6` for body-muted).
- Headings: bold geometric (Poppins, 600–800 weight). Body: Inter, 400–500 weight.
- Minimal, modern layout with generous spacing and clear visual hierarchy.
- Responsive and mobile-first.

Page sections & behavior
1. Header (sticky top)
   - Left: simple logo text "YourBrand" (or SVG placeholder).
   - Right: primary CTA buttons: "Book a Call" (primary fill with cyan) and "Book a Demo" (outline).
   - Header should be transparent over hero then slightly blurred/dark on scroll (subtle).

2. Hero (above the fold)
   - Big headline that reads: "Don't hire more. Automate better. With AI."
   - Subheading: one line summary: "AI chatbots, voice agents, and lead-campaign systems built to convert."
   - Primary CTA (cyan solid): "Book a Call" — link to a provided Calendly / scheduling URL placeholder.
   - Secondary CTA (outline): "Watch Demo" — scrolls to video section.
   - Tiny social proof row under subheading (3 short logos or short trust line e.g. "Trusted by MSMEs & startups").

3. VSL / Video section (prominent)
   - Responsive YouTube embed (16:9) centered; lazy-load iframe.
   - Above or below video: brief caption "Watch how we turn ad clicks into booked calls".
   - When user clicks play, record a data- attribute for analytics (placeholder integration).
   - Include a secondary CTA near video: "Book a Demo" with a calendar link.

4. Services (single row or stacked cards)
   - Minimal three cards with icons, title, 1-2 line description, and small CTA per card:
     1. Chatbots — "WhatsApp, website and messenger bots that capture & qualify leads."
     2. Voice Agents — "Automated calling & IVR agents to reach leads at scale."
     3. Lead Campaign System — "End-to-end lead capture, nurture, follow-up & reporting."
   - Each card: hover lift, cyan border accent, short bullet points (3 max).
   - CTA per card: "Book a Call" (opens modal or link).

5. How it works / Process (3 steps)
   - Step 1: 15-minute discovery call
   - Step 2: Pilot setup & integration
   - Step 3: Launch & scale with dashboards
   - Minimal icons and short copy.

6. Social proof / testimonial area (minimal)
   - One or two testimonials (name, title, short quote) and optional logos strip.

7. Footer
   - Contact links (email / WhatsApp), small legal links, and small copyright.

Conversion behavior & integrations
- Primary conversion flows:
  - "Book a Call" should open an external scheduling link (Calendly or placeholder). Include an accessible modal fallback contact form for users who don’t want to leave the page.
  - "Book a Demo" similar flow; demo can be scheduled via the same or different URL.
- Include placeholder snippet sections for:
  - Google Analytics / GA4 measurement (commented placeholder).
  - Meta pixel (commented placeholder).
  - UTM-friendly link structure so landing works with Instagram ad traffic.
- Add accessible attributes (aria-labels, focus states) and keyboard-accessible modals.

Accessibility & performance
- Lighthouse-friendly: lazy-load images, avoid heavy animation, use optimized SVG icons.
- Provide sensible `alt` text and semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer).
- Ensure good color contrast on dark background for WCAG AA.

File/components expectations
- `pages/index.tsx` — main page, composed of small components.
- `components/Header.tsx`, `components/Hero.tsx`, `components/Video.tsx`, `components/Services.tsx`, `components/Process.tsx`, `components/Testimonial.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`
- Minimal CSS in `globals.css` imported by Tailwind; use utility classes for almost everything.
- Include a small `utils/tracking.ts` with commented placeholders for recording click events (video play, CTA clicks).

Starter copy & placeholders (replace this with final copy later)
- Headline: "Don't hire more. Automate better. With AI."
- Subhead: "We build chatbots, voice agents, and lead-campaign systems that convert ad traffic into paying customers."
- Service short descriptions: (use the three bullets described above).
- Calendly / scheduling link placeholders: `https://calendly.com/your-company/15min` (replaceable)

Deliverables (what I expect from this Replit run)
- A complete Next.js + TypeScript project directory ready to `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
- Clean, readable code with comments where integrations should be added.
- A short README with run/deploy steps and where to replace scheduling/analytics links.
- Optional: a simple export-ready `index.html` static version if requested.

Extra notes to the code generator
- Keep the page minimalist and fast; do not fetch remote heavy libraries other than Google Fonts and Tailwind.
- Use Tailwind’s dark mode; but default the site to the dark theme described.
- Make the primary CTA visually dominant (cyan filled rounded pill).
- Use subtle micro-interactions: hover lifts, slight fade-in on scroll.

End of prompt.
